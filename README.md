# Algorithms-Data-Structure
A repository for practicing &amp; reviewing CS fundamentals</br></br>My approach to practice:</br>
First of all I practice classical problems day by day in my google docs because nowadays many company use that for interview.</br>Secondly, I create test cases and run 
my code in IDE, after that I post what I think the algorithm worthy to learn here. So the number of problems here is relatively small.
It will be very welcome if you would like to discuss with me about the algorithm problems, my email is `lelewang592@gmail.com`
