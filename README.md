# Algorithms-Data-Structure
A repository for practicing &amp; reviewing CS fundamentals</br></br>My approach to practice:</br>
First of all I practice classical problems day by day in my google docs because nowadays many company use that for interview.</br>Secondly, I create test cases and run 
my code in IDE, after that I post what I think the algorithm worthy to learn here. So the number of code here is relatively small, if you want to take a look at all algorithm I am
going through, please check: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHu0glnANDLKgVEIDzomTqjFctIhDIN2-c1y9LUcFFk/edit?usp=sharing
